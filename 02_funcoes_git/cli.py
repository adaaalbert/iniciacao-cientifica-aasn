"""Simple script for vertical throw calculation

Example: A ball is thrown vertically up in the air from an initial height above
the ground at an initial speed. Its subsequent height and speed are given by the
following equations:
height = initial_height + initial_speed * time - (1/2) * GRAVITY * time**2
speed = initial_speed - GRAVITY * time
where GRAVITY = 9.8 m/sÂ², the acceleration due to gravity

This script calculates the height and speed at a time after the ball is thrown.
